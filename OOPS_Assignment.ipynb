    "# The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation: This refers to the bundling of data and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, called an object. \n",
    "# Encapsulation helps to protect data from accidental or unauthorized access.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inheritance: This allows new classes (called subclasses) to be created based on existing classes (called superclasses). Subclasses inherit the \n",
    "# properties and methods of their superclasses, but can also have their own unique properties and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Polymorphism: This means that objects of different classes can be treated as if they were objects of the same class. This allows for more \n",
    "# flexible and reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstraction: This refers to the process of simplifying complex real-world problems by focusing on the essential features and ignoring \n",
    "# irrelevant details. In OOP, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modularity: This refers to the breaking down of a complex system into smaller, more manageable units, called modules. In OOP, modules are \n",
